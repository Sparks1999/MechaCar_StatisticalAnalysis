## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Question 1:
With the r-squared value being a 0.7149 this shows that 71.49% of the variablility is due to the independent variables, meaning that there is little random variablility.

Question 2:
The slope of the linear model is not zero because that would mean that all of the vaiables would have no effect on the mpg of the car. Due to the fact that the p-value is less than 0.05% that mean that the variables had a significant effect on the model.

Question 3:
I would say that the model that we have created does a good job predicting the mpg of any new car data given that r-squared is at 71%.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

With Lot 3's variance being at 170 this means that the production of the suspension coils need to be tweaked to lower the variance so that the consumers of the product have less of a chance to get a bad product.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Overall we cannot reject the null hypothsis although the p-value was close to 0.05. When we do the t-test for each lot individuly it shows that Lot 1 and Lot 2's null hypothsis could not be rejected, whereas in Lot 3 the p-value is below 0.05 which would allow us to reject the null hypothsis. For Lot 3 we could say the means are statisticly diffrent
